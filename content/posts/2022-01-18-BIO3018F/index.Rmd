# About this project

As part of my final-year biological sciences university work, a major assessment in the "Ecology and Evolution" course was a seminar presentation. Students were tasked with presenting a seminar based on a recent journal article relevant to the progression of our knowledge in the fields of ecology and evolution.

The activity aimed to provide a valuable learning experience about the inner workings of science and how to present science. 

The topic that I decided to work on was: "Trend analysis of long-term rainfall data in the
Upper Karoo of South Africa"

In this study, authors critically evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns in rainfall throughout the upper karoo of South Africa.

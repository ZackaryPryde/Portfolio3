My name is Zackary, but most people know me as Zack. I am a B. Sc. qualified individual with a passion for the areas of science related to our world and its future. My skills surround technological innovation and how we can use data to solve problems. With a strong understanding of the biological world, my education has sparked a specific interest in environmental problem solving. The most important lesson that I have learnt throughout my academic journey is that the solutions to problems lies in the data, which in turn gives way to an endless learning process. I have chosen to allocate my personal time among a few challenges ultimately related to data science, whether the problems stem from the environment, the economic realm, or elsewhere. What is important are the skills I learn along the way.

## My academic journey

In my early university years, just like most young academics, the road ahead was not clear. Initially, my majors were physical sciences and human anatomy. In light of a schedule complication, I had to choose between the two. I went into my second academic year majoring in physical sciences and mathematics. Although this was the wrong decision for me in the long run, I was able to pick up some valuable skills along the way, and specifically, I became passionate for the science of data during this period. 

In my final years at university, I had become aware of my academic strengths and personal interests. I had now chosen to major in biological science and applied statistics, and these majors were here to stay. Currently, I am expecting to graduate in June, 2022, with a science degree in the abovementioned fields. Although my academic journey was longer than I had initially expected, I am proud to say that I have learned invaluable skills in multiple   fields of science, while growing personally throughout this period of my career.

title: About
---

My name is Zackary, but most people know me as Zack. I am a B. Sc. qualified individual with a passion for the areas of science related to our world and its future. My skills surround technological innovation and how we can use data to solve problems. With a strong understanding of the biological world, my education has sparked a specific interest in environmental problem solving. The most important lesson that I have learnt throughout my academic journey is that the solutions to problems lies in the data, which in turn gives way to an endless learning process. I have chosen to allocate my personal time among a few challenges ultimately related to data science, whether the problems stem from the environment, the economic realm, or elsewhere. What is important are the skills I learn along the way.

## My academic journey

In my early university years, just like most young academics, the road ahead was not clear. Initially, my majors were physical sciences and human anatomy. In light of a schedule complication, I had to choose between the two. I went into my second academic year majoring in physical sciences and mathematics. Although this was the wrong decision for me in the long run, I was able to pick up some valuable skills along the way, and specifically, I became passionate for the science of data during this period. 

In my final years at university, I had become aware of my academic strengths and personal interests. I had now chosen to major in biological science and applied statistics, and these majors were here to stay. Currently, I am expecting to graduate in June, 2022, with a science degree in the abovementioned fields. Although my academic journey was longer than I had initially expected, I am proud to say that I have learned invaluable skills in multiple fields of science, while growing personally throughout this period of my career. 

## Hobbies

There are a few activities which constitute my list of hobbies. Some of these include: 

* Keeping up with technology and its innovation globally. 
* Software testing.
* Gaming.
* DIY projects. 
* Botany, horticulture, gardening. 
* Teaching. 

## Sports

Throughout my life sports have played a major role in shaping the person I am today. Although my primary and secondary school years were fulled with a suite of sporting activities throughout a given week, I found myself most successful in two specific sports; Judo and Athletics. 

### Judo

From a young age (nine) I represented the provincial judo team. With time, my judo career became more serious, and by the age of sixteen I found myself representing the South African Judo team in international events such as the African Continental championships. At the age of seventeen I obtained my black belt (or "Shodan"). Moving past my final year at high school and into my first years at varsity was a difficult journey. In this time, I continued to climb the national and international athlete rankings. In my initial years in varsity, I decided to continue judo on a more casual level in order to focus on academics, however, this sport will always be close to my heart.

### Athletics

In my secondary school years, I was especially competitive in athletics. Going into varsity, I wanted to continue athletics at a casual level, however, prior to the start of my first semester at the University of Cape Town I was selected to represent the university at the Varsity Cup. I went on to represent the university on numerous occasions at various inter-varsity and provincial league athletics meets, and eventually got selected to represent the provincial athletics team at the Athletics South Africa (ASA) championships. What an incredible experience it was! In this year of study, I was awarded the UCT athletics scholarship. After an injury-induced break from sports in 2018, I decided to continue athletics casually to focus on my academics.
